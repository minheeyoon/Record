I personally have a preference for high-contrast modes, but for the initial version, pure white (#FFFFFF) and black (#000000) were intentionally excluded in the creation of design tokens.

_In the initial version, we aimed to primarily capture the serenity of Dawn. If the opportunity arises, I would like to try making a high-contrast mode that captures the immersive feeling of dawn._

Even with low contrast, the theme was created with consideration for readability and accessibility. (It's not perfect though)."
