# 가나다라마바사아자아자

_룰루랄라_

**결국은 이렇게됐다네**

```
code
```

`code`

내가 힘들 때 울 것 같을 때 (Mm-hm)
기운도 이젠 나지 않을 때 (Mm-hm)
It’s you, 날 걱정하네, it’s you, 날 웃게하네
말 안 해도 돼, boy, what do you say?

(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
멀리든 언제든지 달려와
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
이게 말이 되니 난 물어봐
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
너는 말야, he’s the one that’s living in my system, baby

Oh my, oh my God, 예상했어 나
I was really hoping that he will come through
Oh my, oh my God, 단 너뿐이야
Asking all the time about what I should do

No, I can never let him go (Ooh)
너만 생각나, twenty-four (Ooh)
난 행운아야 정말로 (Ooh)
I know, I know (Ooh)
널 알기 전까지는 나 (Ooh)
의미 없었어 전부 다 (Ooh)
내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸 (Ooh)
I know, I know, I’m going crazy, right?
어디서든, 몇 번이든
There ain’t nothing else that I would hold on to
I hear his voice through all the noise
잠시라도 내 손 놓지 마, no, no
걱정 없잖아
‘Cause I got someone
혼자라도 괜찮아
‘Cause I love someone

(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
멀리든 언제든지 달려와
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
이게 말이 되니 난 물어봐
(They keep on asking me, “Who is he?”)
너는 말야, he’s the one that’s living in my system, baby

Oh my, oh my God, 예상했어 나
I was really hoping that he will come through
Oh my, oh my God, 단 너뿐이야
Asking all the time about what I should do
[Post-Chorus: Haerin, Hyein, Minji]
No, I can never let him go (Ooh)
너만 생각나, twenty-four (Ooh)
난 행운아야 정말로 (Ooh)
I know, I know (Ooh)
널 알기 전까지는 나 (Ooh)
의미 없었어 전부 다 (Ooh)
내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸 (Ooh)
I know, I know (He’s the one that’s living in my system, baby, baby)

Baby
Babe, baby
I’m going crazy, right? (Baby)
Baby
I’m going crazy, right?
Babe, baby
너와 나

My heart is glowing, it’s glowing up (Glow, glow)
너랑만 있으면 무서울 게 없어 (No, no)
가득 메워진, 다 메워진 (붉어진)
My heart is glowing, it’d be glowing
‘Cause he

Oh my, oh my God, 예상했어 나
I was really hoping that he will come through
Oh my, oh my God, 단 너뿐이야
Asking all the time about what I should do (너와 나)

No, I can never let him go (Ooh)
He’s right there for me, twenty-four (Ooh)
난 행운아야 정말로 (Ooh)
I know, I know (너와 나)
널 알기 전까지는 나 (Ooh)
의미 없었어 전부 다 (Ooh)
어떡해
My heart is glowing, it’s glowing
My heart is glowing up so I can’t sleep at night
